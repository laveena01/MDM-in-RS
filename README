# Experimental Data for the Paper 'Hierarchical Fusion and Divergent Activation Based Weakly Supervised Learning for Object Detection from Remote Sensing Images'

In this repository, we provide the implementation of the algorithms developed in the paper 'Hierarchical Fusion and Divergent Activation Based Weakly Supervised Learning for Object Detection from Remote Sensing Images' along with the experimental results, and the methods used for comparison.
The goal is to provide the elements needed to validate and reproduce our research work as well as all the tools needed to reach the same conclusions as we did.
The data used in our experiments that we have the copyright of&nbsp;[[A](http://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3019956),[B](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3843229)] is already published [on zenodo](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3843229).
The licences valid for the elements of this repository are discussed under point [3.&nbsp;Licenses](#3-licenses) below.

## 1. Structure

The repository contains the following items:

1. `CODE_AND_RESULTS.zip` with the source codes and results of our method and the comparison methods,
2. `README` -- this text here.
3. `LICENSE` -- the [MIT&nbsp;License](https://mit-license.org/)

We now focus on the structure of the file `CODE_AND_RESULTS.zip`.
It contains the following items:

1. The directory `new_methods` contains the source code and results of the new methods proposed in our paper.
2. The directory `comparison` contains the source code of the two approaches used for comparison: `ACoL`&nbsp;[A](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2018.00144) and `DANet`&nbsp;[B](http://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2019.00669).
3. The folder `tools_and_metrics` holds additional libraries, software tools, and metrics using in our experiments. 
4. `README` -- this text here.
5. `LICENSE` -- the [MIT&nbsp;License](https://mit-license.org/)

Inside the folder `new_methods`, the following sub-folders are provided:

1. `data` includes data loading code and code for how organizing the input data of the neural network.
2. `expr` includes training code.
3. `model` includes neural network model, basic network and additional modules, depending on the file name, including improved network, and comparison model.
4. `utils` includes some used library functions and test codes when testing, including image segmentation, searching for the largest connected area and data visualization, etc. Verification on the WSADD dataset is done via test_airplane.py and on the DIOR dataset via val_model.py.

In our experiments, we used two datasets:

1. `WSADD`&nbsp;[[A](http://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3019956),[B](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3843229)], which is already published [on zenodo](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3843229) under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) license.
2. The [`DIOR`](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2018.00144)] proposed in&nbsp;[[C](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2019.11.023)].
